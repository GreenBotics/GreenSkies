==========

Lots of new things learned tonight:

- how "percieved"/feels like temperature is computed: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_index
- what EC (Electro condictivity) of liquids for hydro/aquaponics is used for 


I was also , yet again, taking a look at dissolved oxygen & ph **sensors** , and still in shock at their very high price, 
and "fragility" (they have to be recalibrated regularly etc): these sensors are 3 orders of magnitude above the cost of 
temperature/pressure/humidity sensors, but they are **very** important to ensure a reliable, scientific method of
growing plants ...

There are not many ways (if at all) to create these sensors in a DIY manner. 
Somedays, I *really* wish I was either a physicist, a chemist , or both.
