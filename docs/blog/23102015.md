==========

No so much progress in the past few days: 
- simply wired up an other ESP8266 + BME280 combo to act as a second , 
simpler, in door node (likely close by to my existing indoor
aquaponics setup, just to reuse the already running Arduino/replace it).

Really need to pick up speed, still hope to get the WHOLE project finished within a month.




Some more thoughts on software architecture:

- going to favor "simple, clunky & unfancy, but it just works" over some more complex, "elegant"
solutions , this means going for the simplest solutions: for example, I'll just keep seperate
Arduino sketches for the different nodes (which have different sensors, different static ips etc) 
instead of a super dynamic system that can handle different sensors with software toggles etc

Refactoring can come later, and only if the rest works.

Now will I be able to keep things simple for the UI too and not waste time on it ? I better make sure.

- the "hub"'s server should be the one communicating with the different nodes,
not the client directly: this reduces risk of client brining down the sensor nodes
also if the hub is the one who will store the data / aggregate it makes things easier
