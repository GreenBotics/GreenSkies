==========

Hardware:
---------

Managed to get Olimex MOD-WIFI-ESP8266 working!


Things were not as trivial as hoped initially :
 * unlike what the official document says , it is possible to reflash the firmware
 by setting pins 21 LOW and pulsing pin 13 LOW , (or more simply, add two buttons to do it )
 * for some reason, I fried my first FTDI programmer (FTDI basic) on the first try 
 * I'll try and add a wiring schematic here

 Another few things worth noting:
  * the board seems to be much more stable then the Adafruit Huzzah (no weird resets/continuous reboots)
  * so stable in fact that it has been running almost non stop since without much of a hiccup
  * the 3.3v power is supplied by an older Arduino Due and seems fine for my use case

Software:
---------

More progress on the Cycle.js based UI (still need to regroup all of it here)
 * solved issues with Graphing
 * better data handling


Infrastructure and decisions
----------------------------

Storage:
--------

Not sure how to deal with data storage just yet .
Garden weather station would be maximum 10 -15 meters from indoors (and router)...So a fully autonomous station 
might not be needed

Here are a few options 
* sd card directly with the weather station: "simple", perhaps lower power
* raspberry-pi (or similar) acting as a "central hub": this would make it easier to handle multiple "sensor nodes"
(minimal indoor temperature & humidity sensing). This does not entirely solve the storage question, but there are more possibilities.

Power:
------

Needs to be solar for the outside weather station (not quite enough wind in the area), want to avoid complex wiring from within the house.
