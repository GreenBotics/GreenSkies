Open source, somewhat low cost Weather station project



Infos so far:
=============

- temperature, humidity, barometric pressure sensor : BME180 
- anemometer (wind speed) hall effect sensor
- remote  but not too much (garden based) : using a ESP8266 as "brain" + network
- low power as much as possible + solar powered if possible
